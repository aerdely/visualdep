"""
Random variable probability models as tuple objects:

- Exponential (location-dispersion family)
- Kumaraswamy (2 and 4-parameter versions, and mixture of two)
- Pareto
- Student (standard and location-dispersion family)
- Uniform (continuous)

> Dependence on external package: Distributions (just for Student)
